ep01_morty_0005.wav|morty|T-t-that's absolutely crazy!
ep01_morty_0006.wav|morty|Jessica? From my math class?
ep01_morty_0007.wav|morty|No, you can't! J-Jessica doesn't even know I exist. But but but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity.
ep01_morty_0008.wav|morty|What are you talking about, Rick?
ep01_morty_0009.wav|morty|I don't care about Jessica!
ep01_morty_0010.wav|morty|That's it That's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel.

ep01_morty_0012.wav|morty|I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb...
ep01_morty_0013.wav|morty|...person and just let you blow up the whole world.
ep01_morty_0014.wav|morty|Oh, thank God.
ep01_morty_0015.wav|morty|It was?
ep01_morty_0016.wav|morty|I wasn't kissing a pillow, Mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.
ep01_morty_0017.wav|morty|Hi, Jessica.
ep01_morty_0018.wav|morty|Wow. Th-they're both great.
ep01_morty_0019.wav|morty|Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird.
ep01_morty_0020.wav|morty|Rename them?
ep01_morty_0021.wav|morty|Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot.
ep01_morty_0022.wav|morty|Je-Jessica. Jessica.
ep01_morty_0023.wav|morty|Uh, morning, Frank.
ep01_morty_0024.wav|morty|Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.
ep01_morty_0025.wav|morty|Oh, geez, Rick. W-what'd you do to Frank?
ep01_morty_0026.wav|morty|I don't know, Rick. I-I can't leave school again.
ep01_morty_0027.wav|morty|Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip History. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?
ep01_morty_0028.wav|morty|Oh, geez. Okay. Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?
ep01_morty_0029.wav|morty|Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.
ep01_morty_0030.wav|morty|All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?
ep01_morty_0031.wav|morty|Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.
ep01_morty_0032.wav|morty|The Mega trees?
ep01_morty_0033.wav|morty|All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?
ep01_morty_0034.wav|morty|I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.
ep01_morty_0035.wav|morty|Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.
ep01_morty_0036.wav|morty|Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you.
ep01_morty_0037.wav|morty|Sure thing, Rick.
ep01_morty_0038.wav|morty|Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.
ep01_morty_0039.wav|morty|What?!
ep01_morty_0040.wav|morty|Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?
ep01_morty_0041.wav|morty|Uh-oh.
ep01_morty_0042.wav|morty|In my butt?
ep01_morty_0043.wav|morty|Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.
ep01_morty_0044.wav|morty|In my butt?
ep01_morty_0045.wav|morty|Oh, man.
ep01_morty_0046.wav|morty|Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.
ep01_morty_0047.wav|morty|Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.
ep01_morty_0048.wav|morty|They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!
ep01_morty_0049.wav|morty|They're not robots, Rick!
ep01_morty_0050.wav|morty|Holy crap! This is insane!
ep01_morty_0051.wav|morty|Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop. Ju just kidding. You're Morty, right?
ep01_morty_0052.wav|morty|Dad, mom, c-come on. Rick just needed my help is all.
ep01_morty_0053.wav|morty|I do?
ep01_morty_0054.wav|morty|Aw, geez, Dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
ep01_morty_0055.wav|morty|Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.
ep01_morty_0056.wav|morty|1.77245385.
ep01_morty_0057.wav|morty|The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system. Wow! I'm so smart!
ep01_morty_0058.wav|morty|Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.
ep01_morty_0059.wav|morty|Aw, man.
ep01_morty_0060.wav|morty|Ohh, man. Oh, geez! Ohh.
ep01_rick_0000.wav|rick|Morty, you got to come on. You got to come with me.
ep01_rick_0001.wav|rick|I got a surprise for you, Morty.
ep01_rick_0002.wav|rick|I got a surprise for you.
ep01_rick_0003.wav|rick|I got a surprise for you, Morty.
ep01_rick_0004.wav|rick|What do you what do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage.
ep01_rick_0005.wav|rick|Morty, I had to I had to do I had to I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.
ep01_rick_0006.wav|rick|We're gonna drop it down there Just get a whole fresh start, Morty.
ep01_rick_0007.wav|rick|Create a whole fresh start.
ep01_rick_0008.wav|rick|Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
ep01_rick_0009.wav|rick|When I drop the bomb, I don't You know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam. And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and so that's the surprise, Morty.
ep01_rick_0010.wav|rick|I-I get what you're trying to say, M-Morty. Listen, I'm not you don't y-y-you don't got to worry about me trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.
ep01_rick_0011.wav|rick|You you you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she she's all for you, Morty.
ep01_rick_0012.wav|rick|You know what, Morty? You're right. Let's forget the girl all together. She she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.
ep01_rick_0013.wav|rick|Get off of me, Morty!
ep01_rick_0014.wav|rick|What's gotten into you?
ep01_rick_0015.wav|rick|What are you, crazy?
ep01_rick_0016.wav|rick|All right, all right. I'll I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
ep01_rick_0017.wav|rick|We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the s-side of the r-road here.
ep01_rick_0018.wav|rick|You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
ep01_rick_0019.wav|rick|Sure. Why not? I don't I don't know. You you know what, Mo
ep01_rick_0020.wav|rick|What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?
ep01_rick_0021.wav|rick|Mm, there is no God, Summer. You got to rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later.
ep01_rick_0022.wav|rick|"Listen, Jerry, I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar. But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time A bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""Two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""Four."" Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them."
ep01_rick_0023.wav|rick|There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.
ep01_rick_0024.wav|rick|It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. It's important. Come on, Morty.
ep01_rick_0025.wav|rick|Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!
ep01_rick_0026.wav|rick|I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go.
ep01_rick_0027.wav|rick|There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.
ep01_rick_0028.wav|rick|It's dimension 35C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.
ep01_rick_0029.wav|rick|All right. All right. Calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be Holy crap, Morty, run!
ep01_rick_0030.wav|rick|I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!
ep01_rick_0031.wav|rick|Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline.
ep01_rick_0032.wav|rick|Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. W-what the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? Look at it just lumbering around. It defies all logic that thing.
ep01_rick_0033.wav|rick|Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this? You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?
ep01_rick_0034.wav|rick|That's right, Morty the Mega trees with the Mega fruit on them. And that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because y because you're so in love with school.
ep01_rick_0035.wav|rick|You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an under underfoot figure. Just take these shoes, Morty. They're sp special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things ba these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.
ep01_rick_0036.wav|rick|You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!
ep01_rick_0037.wav|rick|Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now. You know, you got to turn the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.
ep01_rick_0038.wav|rick|Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?
ep01_rick_0039.wav|rick|Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.
ep01_rick_0040.wav|rick|Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?
ep01_rick_0041.wav|rick|Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. The stuff was all over the place, Morty.
ep01_rick_0042.wav|rick|There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.
ep01_rick_0043.wav|rick|It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.
ep01_rick_0044.wav|rick|There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through Interdimensional Customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.
ep01_rick_0045.wav|rick|When we get to Customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.
ep01_rick_0046.wav|rick|Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.
ep01_rick_0047.wav|rick|Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through Customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty. And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for Grandpa, Morty. Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.
ep01_rick_0048.wav|rick|Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.
ep01_rick_0049.wav|rick|I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?
ep01_rick_0050.wav|rick|That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those Mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do all kinds of things with them. It's gonna be great, Morty. All kinds of science.
ep01_rick_0051.wav|rick|Why does he have to go over there?
ep01_rick_0052.wav|rick|What new what new machine?
ep01_rick_0053.wav|rick|Run, Morty! Run!
ep01_rick_0054.wav|rick|Don't think about it!
ep01_rick_0055.wav|rick|Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.
ep01_rick_0056.wav|rick|I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.
ep01_rick_0057.wav|rick|It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!
ep01_rick_0058.wav|rick|Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!
ep01_rick_0059.wav|rick|You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.
ep01_rick_0060.wav|rick|Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior. No? No takers? You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
ep01_rick_0061.wav|rick|Takes one to know one.
ep01_rick_0062.wav|rick|What what are you guys doing with my stuff?
ep01_rick_0063.wav|rick|A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.
ep01_rick_0064.wav|rick|What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?
ep01_rick_0065.wav|rick|I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
ep01_rick_0066.wav|rick|Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of Pi.
ep01_rick_0067.wav|rick|The square root of Pi, Morty go.
ep01_rick_0068.wav|rick|Morty, tell your parents the first Law of Thermodynamics.
ep01_rick_0069.wav|rick|I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. H-he needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
ep01_rick_0070.wav|rick|Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say say no? You you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be 100% honesty and open, clear communication.
ep01_rick_0071.wav|rick|No idea what you're talking about.
ep01_rick_0072.wav|rick|Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary super intelligence is just a side effect of the Mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.
ep01_rick_0073.wav|rick|Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. Starting right about now.
ep01_rick_0074.wav|rick|I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty.
ep01_rick_0075.wav|rick|But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. Oh, no, no. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times.

ep02_morty_0001.wav|morty|That was fantastic, Rick!
ep02_morty_0002.wav|morty|W-w-w-what is it?
ep02_morty_0003.wav|morty|"You talking about ""Inception""?"
ep02_morty_0004.wav|morty|"""Inception"" made sense."
ep02_morty_0005.wav|morty|Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?
ep02_morty_0006.wav|morty|Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it. J-J come on, let j let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. Y-y-y-y-y-you're frustrating me.
ep02_morty_0007.wav|morty|Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
ep02_morty_0008.wav|morty|What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
ep02_morty_0009.wav|morty|Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava!
ep02_morty_0010.wav|morty|Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.
ep02_morty_0011.wav|morty|Okay. All right, well... Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell Goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.
ep02_morty_0012.wav|morty|Summer?!
ep02_morty_0013.wav|morty|Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
ep02_morty_0014.wav|morty|It's S-S-S-Summer!
ep02_morty_0015.wav|morty|What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version of a Centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?
ep02_morty_0016.wav|morty|Ohhhhh! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!
ep02_morty_0017.wav|morty|Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.
ep02_morty_0018.wav|morty|Ohhhh!
ep02_morty_0019.wav|morty|"We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math?"
ep02_morty_0020.wav|morty|"Man, he sure says ""Bitch"" a lot!"
ep02_morty_0021.wav|morty|But that's the opposite of what
ep02_morty_0022.wav|morty|Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we <i>could</i> hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.
ep02_morty_0023.wav|morty|Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.
ep02_morty_0024.wav|morty|Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know... ...scare Scary Terry.
ep02_morty_0025.wav|morty|Hey, leave him alone!
ep02_morty_0026.wav|morty|Hey, yo, Scary T., don't even trip about your pants...dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool.

ep02_morty_0035.wav|morty|Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.

ep02_morty_0040.wav|morty|Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.
ep02_morty_0041.wav|morty|You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.
ep02_rick_0000.wav|rick|Episode 2 Rick Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.
ep02_rick_0001.wav|rick|I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.
ep02_rick_0002.wav|rick|Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.
ep02_rick_0003.wav|rick|All right, Ruffles What's his name? Snuffles. Snuffles, shake. Roll over. Go to the bathroom.
ep02_rick_0004.wav|rick|Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.
ep02_rick_0005.wav|rick|Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
ep02_rick_0006.wav|rick|It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.
ep02_rick_0007.wav|rick|That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense.
ep02_rick_0008.wav|rick|You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're g we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.
ep02_rick_0009.wav|rick|Uh-oh! Spoilers! I'm a full season behind.
ep02_rick_0010.wav|rick|It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.
ep02_rick_0011.wav|rick|All right, Morty, time to make our move.
ep02_rick_0012.wav|rick|Allahu Akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math! Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!
ep02_rick_0013.wav|rick|Take cover, Morty! Ooh! Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. I-I-I-I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty. But we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.
ep02_rick_0014.wav|rick|Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!
ep02_rick_0015.wav|rick|Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!
ep02_rick_0016.wav|rick|Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
ep02_rick_0017.wav|rick|Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.
ep02_rick_0018.wav|rick|Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!
ep02_rick_0019.wav|rick|Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!
ep02_rick_0020.wav|rick|Don't judge, Morty.
ep02_rick_0021.wav|rick|Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.
ep02_rick_0022.wav|rick|Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.
ep02_rick_0023.wav|rick|Aw, geez. Looks like Goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.
ep02_rick_0024.wav|rick|Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete’s sake! This is disgusting! I'm gonna puke!
ep02_rick_0025.wav|rick|Time to go another dream deep, Morty!
ep02_rick_0026.wav|rick|Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?
ep02_rick_0027.wav|rick|Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
ep02_rick_0028.wav|rick|We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!
ep02_rick_0029.wav|rick|Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
ep02_rick_0030.wav|rick|Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!
ep02_rick_0031.wav|rick|What are we here for again? Incepting?
ep02_rick_0032.wav|rick|Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we <i>can</i> run but we <i>can't</i> hide. I say we try hiding.
ep02_rick_0033.wav|rick|Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?
ep02_rick_0034.wav|rick|Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
ep02_rick_0035.wav|rick|Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.
ep02_rick_0036.wav|rick|Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.
ep02_rick_0037.wav|rick|Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.
ep02_rick_0038.wav|rick|Looks like Scary Terry's having a nightmare.
ep02_rick_0039.wav|rick|Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?
ep02_rick_0040.wav|rick|You're putting too much pressure on yourself, Scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.
ep02_rick_0041.wav|rick|You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.
ep02_rick_0042.wav|rick|As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.
ep02_rick_0043.wav|rick|Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?
ep02_rick_0044.wav|rick|Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.
ep02_rick_0045.wav|rick|- Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.
ep02_rick_0046.wav|rick|All right, let's get out of here. If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
ep02_rick_0047.wav|rick|It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?
ep02_rick_0048.wav|rick|Ooh, great plan, Jerry.
ep02_rick_0049.wav|rick|No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.
ep02_rick_0050.wav|rick|We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside Snuffles' dream.
ep02_rick_0051.wav|rick|"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie."
ep02_rick_0052.wav|rick|No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.
ep02_rick_0053.wav|rick|Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.
ep02_rick_0054.wav|rick|Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
ep02_rick_0055.wav|rick|It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.
ep02_rick_0056.wav|rick|It's pretty bad, Emperor Snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation.
ep02_rick_0057.wav|rick|I think it will be great, Morty. You know, it's g i-i-i-i-it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.
ep02_rick_0058.wav|rick|What do you know, Morty? What do you know?
ep02_rick_0059.wav|rick|This is how you dream, bitch.
ep03_morty_0000.wav|morty|You know, I thought it was about being born half-god or something.
ep03_morty_0001.wav|morty|Aw, geez, Rick. What'd you do?
ep03_morty_0002.wav|morty|Uh, w-w-w-where where do I find Dr. Bloom?
ep03_morty_0003.wav|morty|Reuben, Minne Minnesota?
ep03_morty_0004.wav|morty|Rick, where am I?
ep03_morty_0005.wav|morty|Entrance to what?
ep03_morty_0006.wav|morty|Oh, my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?
ep03_morty_0007.wav|morty|Huh? No, no. I'm just reading 'em out loud in the order that I'm seeing 'em.
ep03_morty_0008.wav|morty|It's really scary in here, Rick.
ep03_morty_0009.wav|morty|Rick! It's a monster!
ep03_morty_0010.wav|morty|grandpa Rick sent me!
ep03_morty_0011.wav|morty|Exhibits?
ep03_morty_0012.wav|morty|Diseases?
ep03_morty_0013.wav|morty|Well, I guess we better check it out.
ep03_morty_0014.wav|morty|I'll go.
ep03_morty_0015.wav|morty|I'm not. I'm doing it because it's fun.
ep03_morty_0016.wav|morty|Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, what are those things?
ep03_morty_0017.wav|morty|You're not gonna die! What's your name?
ep03_morty_0018.wav|morty|Rick R-R-Reuben's got tuberculosis!
ep03_morty_0019.wav|morty|Oh, man. W-w-w-what is that horrible smell?
ep03_morty_0020.wav|morty|Forget about the park, doctor! How do we get out?
ep03_morty_0021.wav|morty|Everybody, head for the colon!
ep03_morty_0022.wav|morty|Hey, just so you know, I-I-I'm actually 14. So, you know...
ep03_morty_0023.wav|morty|Not 12.
ep03_morty_0024.wav|morty|You know, because he just said I was 12.
ep03_morty_0025.wav|morty|Doc, didn't you say that the body was filling with gas?
ep03_morty_0026.wav|morty|Everybody, in here!
ep03_morty_0027.wav|morty|Poncho? What is this in your backpack?
ep03_morty_0028.wav|morty|Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick.
ep03_morty_0029.wav|morty|Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die! Let's go!
ep03_morty_0030.wav|morty|Uh, well...
ep03_morty_0031.wav|morty|We're in the areola, Rick almost to the nipple, but we're also in a really bad situation!
ep03_morty_0032.wav|morty|Oh my God, the track!
ep03_morty_0033.wav|morty|Um...wait Did we have some sort of relationship with him?
ep03_morty_0034.wav|morty|I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead.
ep03_morty_0035.wav|morty|Hey, w-w-what the hell, Rick?! What the hell, man! I liked her! I really had something going there, Rick!
ep03_morty_0036.wav|morty|W-what's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me. I don't know.
ep03_rick_0000.wav|rick|A-ho, ho, ho, everybody.
ep03_rick_0001.wav|rick|Calm down, Jerry. This is Reuben, an old friend.
ep03_rick_0002.wav|rick|I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation.
ep03_rick_0003.wav|rick|Don't worry about your C-Christmas, Jerry. I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise.
ep03_rick_0004.wav|rick|Hi, Joyce. Leonard. Hello, there. Merry Christmas, man. Morty, a moment of your time? He's in bad shape, Morty.
ep03_rick_0005.wav|rick|Gee, thanks, Morty. W-w-what kind of monster do you think I am? I-I-I'm sitting here trying to save the guy's life. I need your help. I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's going on.
ep03_rick_0006.wav|rick|In Reuben.
ep03_rick_0007.wav|rick|Reuben on the table, Morty. Look, I-I-I I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.
ep03_rick_0008.wav|rick|He's busy.
ep03_rick_0009.wav|rick|- Morty, can you hear me? Head north.
ep03_rick_0010.wav|rick|Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance.
ep03_rick_0011.wav|rick|Welcome, Morty. Welcome... ...to Anatomy Park! It's a little business venture I've been cooking up on the side with Dr. Bloom an amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't ch cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.
ep03_rick_0012.wav|rick|You got a problem with that last one, Morty?
ep03_rick_0013.wav|rick|Okay. All right. If I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby. You know, I got I got a lot of pushback when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, all right? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty. Proceed to the liver.
ep03_rick_0014.wav|rick|The liver's under maintenance. Reuben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great.
ep03_rick_0015.wav|rick|No, no, no. Morty. The only monster here is alco......holism. That is an animatronic werewolf.
ep03_rick_0016.wav|rick|Hey, Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's going on here?
ep03_rick_0017.wav|rick|Watch it.
ep03_rick_0018.wav|rick|Just take a deep breath, Reuben.
ep03_rick_0019.wav|rick|Oh, great work, Morty. Okay, I'll just cure it and then Okay. Well, I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor and pop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's great, Morty. It's a bunch of pirates running around a pancreas. We don't whitewash it, either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get, you know, you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible, please, you gotta treat yourself.
ep03_rick_0020.wav|rick|Oof. Ugh. Morty. Strike one.
ep03_rick_0021.wav|rick|Morty, you want to put it on mute or something? I'm I'm trying to concentrate.
ep03_rick_0022.wav|rick|Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry.
ep03_rick_0023.wav|rick|R-relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite. Morty, can you get to the left nipple?
ep03_rick_0024.wav|rick|No, Morty, I'm talking about Reuben's left nipple.
ep03_rick_0025.wav|rick|I'm almost there, Morty!
ep03_rick_0026.wav|rick|Where's Dr. Bloom?
ep03_rick_0027.wav|rick|God damn it, Morty. I ask you to do one thing!
ep03_rick_0028.wav|rick|Too bad about Dr. Bloom. He was a genius the only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.
ep03_rick_0029.wav|rick|What about... Pirates of the Pancreas?
ep03_rick_0030.wav|rick|Boo-yah! Hold your breath.
ep03_rick_0031.wav|rick|Yeah, so I heard. you dodged a bullet, Morty trust me. Puffy vagina.
ep03_rick_0032.wav|rick|Come on, let's get some stuffing. I'm starving.
ep03_rick_0033.wav|rick|Oh, unbelievable. We got we got a bunch of robot, computer people, sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens. Do you guys realize that Christ was born today? Jesus Christ, our savior, was born today. Are are are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?
ep03_rick_0034.wav|rick|Loud and clear, Annie.
ep03_rick_0035.wav|rick|Hey, everybody.
ep03_rick_0036.wav|rick|Yeah. Talk to me.
ep03_rick_0037.wav|rick|Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.
